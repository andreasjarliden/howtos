Move a pane to a different window
---------------------------------

Move to the pane to move

C-b ! (to break the pane to its own window)
C-b :join-pane -t :<window number>

Note: - :<window number> is shorthand for [session]:window
      - -t stands for target
      - Use -s (source) instead to move a different window to the current
        window
